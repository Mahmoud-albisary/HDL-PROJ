# Basys3 with system verilog
This is a repo for FPGA programming for educational purposes.
 
In this repositery the Basys3 development board will be used, it is based on the Artix-7 FPGA, and known to be used for educational purposes for more infomation check the link https://digilent.com/reference/_media/basys3:basys3_rm.pdf.

## AI Assistance
As we see today LLMs have altered the way we work on projects, and the projects in this repo are no exception. So, I would like to tell that I am the one responsible for the projects ideas and approach, but used the help of ChatGPT in the following:

- Code debugging in some cases
- Some tasks that are not directly related to FPGA programming i.e. writing the common dirs and file names that are usually ignored in the .gitignore file.
- Text generation for some parts of the documentation provided

The main aim is to make the process faster and easier not to rely on AI, which contradicts the real purpose of the repo.
